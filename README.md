## Delete files from a directory


</div>

### Description

This program will permanently delete all files from a working directory.

This program is aimed at beginners so that they can get to know how to

use the kill statement, something I learnt recently myself. This

program removes all files from a working directory on a computer, but

leaves folders intact if there are any contained within the directory

itself. This is something I am working on to improve. If you have any

comments on this submission, please do leave them since I'd love to

hear what you have to say and do vote if you like the program.
